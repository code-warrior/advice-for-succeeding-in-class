## Academic Integrity

The work you submit must be your own. You are welcome to discuss concepts and ideas with your classmates and anyone else, but you are **not** to share code with anyone. See the **Academic Integrity** section of the syllabus for more, including a link to the collegeâ€™s official document on the matter.
