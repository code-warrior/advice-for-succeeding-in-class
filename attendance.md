## Attendance

Attending lectures is crucial, for obvious reasons. Aside from emergencies, everyone should attend *every* class.

If you are absent for any reason, you are responsible for *all* the material and announcements covered in the session you missed. Do not ask me for notes, as I do not have any to share. Make one or more note-taking friends in class so you can share notes, and/or post to the Google Group asking for a classmate to share their notes.

Also note that being absent from a crit lecture is more egregious than an absence from a regular lecture, since feedback for your project and your feedback for others is very important.

**Note**: Excessive absences will lead to a failing grade.
