## Attendance

Attending lectures is crucial, for obvious reasons. Aside from emergencies, everyone should attend *every* class.

If you are absent for any reason, you are responsible for *all* the material and announcements covered in the session you missed. Please do not ask me for notes, as I do not have any to share. Make one or more note-taking friends in class so you can share notes, and/or post to our common forum asking a classmate to share their notes.

**Note**: Excessive absences will lead to a failing grade, because of the correlation between attendance and classroom success.
