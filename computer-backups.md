## Computer Backups

You are responsible for ensuring that your work is backed up continuously. Hard drives and USB flash drives are cheap, and backup methods are simple — especially on a Mac. There is *no* excuse *not* to backup. Use Time Machine if you’re on a Mac, or File History if you are using Windows. Also consider Backblaze, which is a cloud-based backup utility available for Mac and Windows that costs about $50 per year.
