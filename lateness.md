## Lateness

If you come to class late and miss roll call at the beginning of class, I will not interrupt the lecture to update my roster. It is *your* responsibility to come to me during the break or after class to let me know that were late. This *has* to be done *in person* and *on the day you are late*. Otherwise, the absence remains.

Bear in mind that you are responsible for any announcements and/or material you missed before your late arrival to class.

**Note**: Excessive lateness will be converted to absences, which can lead to failing the course.
