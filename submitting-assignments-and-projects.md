## Submitting Assignments and Projects

Unless otherwise stated in your course’s syllabus, *every* assignment and project for this course *must* be submitted via GitHub. **There are *no* exceptions.** You work is only considered “submitted” when a pull request of your assignment is “approved.” We’ll discuss in class what this means.
